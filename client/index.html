            <p>Beginning with the Pearl Harbor attacks, the Pacific Theater was fought mainly between the U.S and Japan
                and covered a large part of the Pacfic Ocean and Southeast Asia. Japan was easily moving across China
                and Southeast Asia, but the Japanese awoke a sleeping giant when they attacked America: they did not
                complete all the objectives of Pearl Harbor, and they vastly underestimated the industrial and military
                power of the United States.

            <img class="ui small right floated rounded image" src="/client/img/ship.jpeg">
            <p>With the element of surprise, the Japanese enjoyed early military victories,
                but by mid-1942, the tide was starting to turn. After the battle of Midway, the Americans began to
                control the Pacific Ocean. This battle is considered the beginning of the end, and once American
                carriers were in range of the mainland, American bombers conducted devastating raids on Japanese cities,
                culminating in the two atomic bombs that forced Japan to surrender. While smaller than the European
                Front, the Pacific Theater was a brutal, bloody affair that resulted in over two million deaths directly
                caused by military action and had impacts that are still felt today.

                This website explores the Pacific War in four aspects. The first being the attitudes of each nation
                toward the war. This includes the government's role as well as the ideas of "staying neutral" and
                Japanese
                imperialism. Also, there are categories for both land and naval battles, which also include the impact
                of technology and the conditions of the battles fought. Lastly, it explores the end of the war, which
                also includes the impacts beyond World War II itself.

                        America initially wanted to remain neutral in World War Two; they viewed the conflict as
                        “Europe’s problem” and thought getting involved would only harm the U.S. American citizens. The
                        government was not keen on getting involved in another potentially devastating conflict so
                        soon after World War One. However, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, Americans were shocked and
                        angered,
                        and a poll a few days after the attack showed that 97% of Americans supported declaring war. War
                        was declared immediately after the attack on December 8. First, however, America needed to
                        intervene in Europe, as France had been taken over and Nazi Germany was advancing rapidly across
                        Europe. America was taken by surprise and lost much of its territory in the Pacific, since it
                        was not
                        able to immediately deal with the Japanese threat. America was united against Japan, and men
                        were drafted and encouraged to join the fight. Racism was also a factor in American hatred of
                        the Japanese; not only was there general racism among the American population, but executive
                        order 9066 rounded up over 120,000 Japanese-American citizens and placed them in internment
                        camps. The government feared that some were secretly spies and were disloyal to the U.S.

                <div class="ui raised segment">
                    <p>Even before America entered World War Two and the Pacific War began, Japan attempted to gain
                        territory in South and Southeast Asia to fuel its own territorial ambitions. Japan invaded China
                        and made rapid gains, also annexing Korea and Manchuria, among others. However, Japan was not
                        able to produce large quantities of important resources, such as rubber. During the 1930’s Japan
                        grew even more aggressive and militaristic, looking down on other nations and becoming
                        increasingly antagonistic towards America and its allies. Japan knew that it would eventually
                        have to fight a war if it wanted to realize its ambitions, and it started to build battleships
                        that violated treaties such as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. The Japanese navy gradually
                        began mobilizing, and the first fleet was formed on April 10th, 1941. In July 1941, Japan
                        invaded the southern part of French Indochina which prompted the U.S to impose an embargo on oil
                        products to Japan. Japan particularly wanted the Dutch East Indies for their oilfields, in
                        addition to the Philippines and Malaya. On December 7, 1941, after meticulous planning, Pearl
                        Harbor was attacked. This brought the United States into the war, united against the Japanese
                        and reeling from their initial losses.

                        The Japanese were unhappy with the outcome of World War One; while they were on the winning
                        side, they did not gain any territory and still had trouble producing important resources. The
                        Japanese government slowly became more militaristic and totalitarian, and Emperor Hirohito was
                        touted as a “living god.” Japanese schools taught that the Japanese were superior and other
                        nations were subhuman. Children were highly encouraged to join the military, and training began
                        in schools. Citizens were pressured or forced to either fight in the war or work as laborers.
                        The Pearl Harbor attack was partly to realize a Japanese victory over the United States, and
                        also as revenge for the U.S oil embargo and providing aid to the Chinese. When the war later
                        became desperate for the Japanese, they resorted to kamikaze - suicide tactics - methods in
                        order to win: they viewed surrender as highly dishonorable and it was expected that a soldier
                        would sacrifice himself for victory and their emporer. Even before World War One, Japanese High
                        Command had a list of potential enemies, of which one was the United States, showing that the
                        Japanese were always weary and preparing for war in the future.

                            The Battle of Attu was the only land battle fought in North America during World War II.

                    On June 7, 1942, the Japanese invaded and occupied Attu. Attu was a remote island part of the
                    Aleutian region in the North Pacific close to the Alaskan Peninsula
                    It is thought that Japan seized Attu primarily to divert the U.S. during the attack on Midway
                    Island
                    (June 4–7, 1942) in the central Pacific.
                    Americans were surprised that Japanese troops could take any U.S. land, no matter how remote or
                    insignificant. Some Americans also feared that this might be the first step toward an attack against
                    mainland Alaska or even the U.S. Northwest. On March 26, 1943, the U.S. Navy managed to secure the
                    sea lanes and clear the way for an attack on Attu. Then, on May 11, 1943, in a mission code-named
                    Operation Landgrab, the U.S. soldiers at first encountered only light resistance. Still, the
                    island’s harsh weather and rugged terrain proved to be helpful for the Japanese.
                    The U.S. Army planners had expected the battle to last only a few days and had not anticipated how
                    grueling the conditions would be, American soldiers conducted operations in substandard clothing
                    with inadequate gear.
                    However, the Americans were supported by naval and aerial bombardment against Japanese positions,
                    and aided
                    by reinforcements and new supplies. By the end of May, U.S. troops had managed to take the high
                    ground on the island and trap Yamasaki’s troops in a small hillside area where they were quickly
                    running out of food and ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers, mostly adhered to the
                    traditional Bushido code, “way of the warrior”, forbidding surrender as the ultimate dishonor, began
                    to commit suicide or prepare for the final charge. On May 29, 1943, Yamasaki and his remaining
                    troops charged the American position in one of the largest banzai charges (all out desperate attack)
                    of the Pacific War. Their sudden frontal assault on the initially penetrated all the way to
                    caught-off guard support troops in the rear of the American camp. Brutal hand-to-hand combat
                    followed until Yamasaki and his men were finally routed by overwhelming firepower.

                    By the time American troops landed on Okinawa, the war on the European front was nearing its end. In
                    the Pacific theater, however, American forces were still suffering conquering Japan’s Home Islands,
                    one after another. After winning the brutal Battle of Iwo Jima, they turned to the island of
                    Okinawa, the last stop before reaching Japan. The Japanese knew if Okinawa fell, so would Japan. The
                    Americans knew securing Okinawa’s air bases was crucial to finishing the war. On April 1, 1945,
                    morale was low among American troops, but they still launched the largest bombardment ever to
                    support a troop landing. Troops landing on Okinawa’s beaches surged inland with little resistance.
                    Wave after wave of troops, tanks, ammunition and supplies went ashore almost effortlessly within
                    hours. The troops quickly secured the two airfields. However, the Japanese army was waiting for
                    them. As they progressed deeper, American troops wondered when and where they’d finally encounter
                    resistance. The Japanese Imperial Army had them right where they wanted them. To defend the island,
                    Japanese troops hunkered down in a network of caves and dugouts. Much of the fighting was
                    hand-to-hand and particularly ruthless. The Americans finally took Hacksaw Ridge on May 6. To
                    encourage their surrender, General Buckner initiated propaganda warfare and dropped millions of
                    leaflets declaring the war was all but lost for Japan. When faced with the reality that further
                    fighting was futile, General Ushijima and his Chief of Staff, General Cho, committed ritual suicide
                    on June 22, effectively ending the Battle of Okinawa. Winning the Battle of Okinawa put Allied
                    forces within striking distance of Japan. But wanting to bring the war to a swift end, and knowing
                    there were 2 million Japanese troops waiting for the American soldiers, President Truman decided to
                    drop two atomic bombs.

                    Allied soldiers had to contend with heat constantly above ninety degrees and sometimes one-hundred
                    degrees fahrenheit. The thick fog and heavy rains made it difficult to travel and identify enemy

                    Allied soldiers captured by the Japanese could not expect to be treated well or even to survive for
                    very
                    long. In addition to their using their prisoners for forced labor and their brutal attitude towards
                    warfare,
                    the Japanese viewed surrender as the height of dishonor, and looked down on enemy soldiers that
                    surrendered,
                    viewing them as cowardly and less than human for surrendering instead of dying. They therefore did
                    not
                    always see an issue with mistreating enemy captives, and American POWs felt the consequences with
                    high
                    casualty rates. The Bataan death march is one of the most well-known instances of Japanese
                    mistreatment of
                    enemy POWs. The Japanese immediately invaded the Philippines after Pearl Harbor, and the Bataan
                    province
                    fell in April of 1942. Over 60,000 American and Filipino soldiers that survived the fight were taken
                    to a
                    Japanese prison camp where they were tortured and shown no mercy by Japanese soldiers; during which
                    several hundred soldiers died. A newspaper published in San Francisco in 1942 examines the horrors
                    that the
                    soldiers faced on the march; “the guards clubbed prisoners who tried to get water, and one prisoner
                    was
                    clubbed for helping a fellow prisoner who had been knocked down by a Japanese army truck. Soldiers
                    were
                    tortured or killed for trying to find food or escape. When the soldiers were finally liberated, a
                    further
                    2,200 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died at Camp O’Donnell, a U.S army camp that housed the
                    survivors.

            the point

            The Higgins boat, invented by Andrew Higgins, featured a new hull that prevented
            propeller grounding and allowed amphibious assaults with far fewer casualties than would have occurred
            otherwise. This significantly reduced the amount of soldiers and supplies needed to storm an enemy beach,
            which was very useful for fighting on the island chains in the Pacific. Indeed, amphibious assaults were
            used to great effect throughout the Pacific front; they were the main form of attack in ship-to-shore
            warfare, where ground forces received extensive support from nearby naval guns. Engineers were used
            extensively in these attacks as they had experience crossing rivers and defusing mines. The U.S conducted 39
            major amphibious assaults in the Pacific theater.

                    Pearl Harbor is a U.S. naval base near Honolulu, Hawaii, where the Japanese launched a surprise
                    attack. Just before 8 a.m.,
                    hundreds of Japanese fighter planes descended on the base, where they managed to destroy/damage
                    almost 20 American naval vessels and over 300 airplanes. More than
                    2,400 Americans died in the attack, including civilians, and another 1,000 people were wounded. The
                    day after the assault, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan.

                    The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise, but Japan and the United States had been edging toward
                    a full-out war for decades.

                    The United States was unhappy with Japan’s attempts to invade China.

                    Japan declared war on China in 1937, resulting in the Nanking Massacre and other
                    awful events.

                    American officials responded economically. They reasoned that if Japan lacked access to money and
                    goods, and
                    essential supplies
                    like oil, Japan would have slow down.
                    Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, is located near the center of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 2,000 miles from the
                    U.S. mainland and about 4,000 miles from Japan. No one believed that the Japanese would start a war
                    with an attack on the distant islands of Hawaii.

                    American intelligence was confident that any Japanese attack would take
                    place in one of the nearby European colonies in the South Pacific.

                    Because American military leaders were not expecting an attack so close to home, the naval
                    facilities at Pearl Harbor were relatively undefended.

                    From Japan's point of view, Pearl Harbor was an irresistibly easy target.
                    The Japanese plan was to destroy the Pacific Fleet. That way, the Americans would not be able
                    to fight back as Japan’s forces spread across the South Pacific. On December 7, after months
                    of planning and practice, the Japanese launched their attack.

                    Less than two hours later, the surprise attack was over, and every battleship in Pearl Harbor—USS
                    Arizona, USS Oklahoma, USS California, USS West Virginia, USS Utah, USS Maryland, USS Pennsylvania,
                    USS Tennessee and USS Nevada—had sustained significant damage.

                    However, the Japanese had failed to cripple the Pacific Fleet. By the 1940s, battleships were no
                    longer
                    the most important naval vessel: it was actually the aircraft carries, luckily, all of the Pacific
                    Fleet’s carriers were away from the base on that fated day.

                    Moreover, the Pearl Harbor assault had left the base’s repair buildings intact. As a result, the
                    U.S. Navy was able to
                    rebound relatively quickly from the attack.

                    President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress on December 8, the

                    He said, “No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the
                    American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. I believe I interpret
                    the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to
                    the uttermost, but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us
                    again.”
                    The Japanese only wanted to coax the United States into an agreement to lift the economic sanctions
                    against them; but it backfired, they had spurred America into a global conflict.

                    The Battle of Midway was a huge clash between the U.S. Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy.
                    Japan’s efforts to establish clear naval and air superiority in the western Pacific first hit a snag
                    in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, when the U.S. fleet turned back a Japanese invasion
                    force headed for New Guinea. Despite the setback, Admiral Isaroku Yamamoto, commander of the
                    Imperial Japanese Navy, was convinced his forces enjoyed a numerical advantage over the Americans.

                    U.S. Navy cryptanalysts had begun breaking Japanese communication codes early in 1942, and knew well
                    ahead of time that Japan was planning an attack in the Pacific at a location they suspected was
                    Midway. The Navy decided to send out a false message from the base claiming it was
                    short of fresh water.

                    Admiral Yamamoto had to transmit all strategy over the radio,
                    enabling Navy cryptanalysts based in Hawaii to figure out when Japan planned to attack.

                    Before dawn the next day, Japan launched the first phase of its attack as planned, sending
                    108 Japanese warplanes from its four aircraft carriers to strike Midway. After inflicting heavy
                    damage to the U.S. base, the first attack ended by 7 a.m., but the airfield was still functional.

                    Shortly after that, U.S. aircraft launched from Midway and began attacking the four Japanese
                    carriers, to no avail.

                    Meanwhile, a wave of U.S. Devastator torpedo bombers from the U.S. carriers Hornet and Enterprise
                    arrived to attack the Japanese ships. Nearly all of them were shot
                    down by Japanese Zero fighters because they were unescorted by fighter planes. But about an hour
                    later another wave of U.S. carrier-launched bombers struck, crippling three Japanese carriers:
                    Akagi,
                    Kaga and Soryu.

                    Japan’s surviving carrier, Hiryu, launched attacks but the U.S. dive-bombers from all three carriers
                    returned to
                    attack the Hiryu and set it destroy it as well, putting all four Japanese carriers out of
                    commission.


                    Major combat in the Battle of Midway was over by the evening of June 4, but U.S. troops at sea
                    and on Midway Island continued their attacks on the Japanese over the next two days.

                    On June 6, Yamamoto ordered his ships to retreat, ending the Battle of Midway. In short, Japan had
                    lost as many as 3,000 men, nearly 300
                    aircraft, one heavy cruiser and four aircraft carriers in the battle, while the Americans lost two
                    aircraft carriers, around 145 aircraft, and approximately 360 servicemen.

                    As a result of the U.S. victory in the Battle of Midway, Japan abandoned its plan to expand its
                    reach in the Pacific, and was put on the defensive. The
                    battle injected U.S. forces with confidence and drained Japanese morale, turning the tide of war in
                    the Pacific signifigantly in favor of the Allies.

        <div class="ui raised segment">
            The kamikaze suicide pilot was Japan’s most ruthless weapon. The pilots were instructed to dive their planes
            into ships and cause as much destruction as possible. They were under the impression that they were dying in
            the most honorable way. On April 4, 1945, the Japanese unleashed these
            well-trained pilots on the Fifth Fleet. Some dove their planes into ships at speeds of 500 miles per hour
            causing
            immense damage. American sailors tried desperately to shoot the kamikaze planes down but were often
            sitting ducks against
            enemy pilots willing to die with their planes. There was essentially nothing that could be done against
            someone with nothing to lose.

                <div class="ui raised segment">
                    At the end of 1944, the Japanese were in dire straits; they were nearly out of much needed supplies
                    and natural resources, like oil, and the majority of their navy had been lost to America’s much
                    larger navy and air force. It was clear that the Japanese were going to lose, and in April of 1943,
                    MacArthur was appointed commander of all U.S ground forces, and admiral Nimitiz was appointed
                    commander of all U.S naval forces in order to expedite a potential invasion of Japan. In July of
                    1945, Truman called for Japan’s surrender, calling for “prompt and utter destruction” if they did
                    not. Throughout the summer of 1945, American bombs and guns hammered on the Japanese coast,
                    preparing for a potential invasion that would end in 1946. Even with most of Japan’s forces
                    decimated, the invasion was going to be extremely costly. Japanese troops received orders to fight
                    to the last man, and to them, death was infinitely preferable to surrender. This was present in the
                    liberal use of suicide tactics in both naval and ground combat, and in the battle of Okinawa 110,000
                    Japanese troops were killed, while less than 8,000 were taken prisoner. The commanding general and
                    his staff committed seppuku so as not to be taken prisoner by the Americans. American troops had to
                    destroy each Japanese fortification singly, and the Japanese did not surrender under nearly the last
                    possible second. America wanted unconditional surrender, and die-hard sections of the Japanese
                    government believed that unconditional surrender would be the equivalent of mass destruction. The
                    most conservative estimates for an invasion of Japan estimated the U.S would suffer over 225,000
                    casualties. Even after the first atomic bomb, emperor Hirohito refused to surrender.

                <div class="ui raised segment">
                    On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb, Trinity, was successfully detonated. The primary reason for
                    dropping the atomic bomb was to encourage Japanese surrender and save American lives, knowing that
                    millions of American soldiers and Japanese citizens would be lost in the invasion of Japan. However,
                    there are other potential reasons why Truman may have wanted to drop the bomb instead of invading.
                    The Soviet Union was also at war with Japan, and Truman knew that Japan would have capitulated upon
                    the entry of the Russians into the war, significantly reducing the number of American casualties in
                    a potential invasion. The bomb was seen as a way to end the war before the Soviet’s entered Japan,
                    meaning the territory and spoils of victory were America’s alone. America wanted to end the war
                    before the Soviet Union could grab pieces of the Asian mainland, and the bombs were not necessary
                    but were used to accelerate the surrender process and force divided elements of the Japanese
                    government to see reason. Racism could have made it easier to drop the bombs as well, as Americans
                    likely did not see it as a crime; most Americans supported the bomb droppings without thinking of
                    the
                    moral consequences, and America’s hatred for the Japanese and the practice of total war made the
                    decision very easy.

                <div class="ui raised segment">
                    The atomic bomb was not just a cutting-edge weapon that led to the instant death of tens of
                    thousands of Japanese civilians; there were lasting impacts on both Japanese citizens and on the
                    world as a whole. Japanese citizens suffered radiation poisoning and genetic diseases that are still
                    present today, and far more suffered as a result of the bombs than those that died in the first
                    year. The Japanese were scared of these weapons, and surrendered partly out of shock. The emperor of
                    Japan said that “the enemy used cruel bombs.” More importantly, never before did mankind have the
                    capacity to destroy itself. With atomic weapons, the damage a war could do increased drastically,
                    and countries became afraid of fighting other nuclear powers. The primary super-power opposing the
                    United States was the Soviet Union, and even though the two countries had worked together to fight a
                    common enemy in World War 2, they now opposed one another, each holding very different ideologies.
                    America came out of the war as the dominant western superpower, now effectively in control of Japan
                    for the time being, and they faced the Soviet Union, the only superpower after the war strong enough
                    to rival the United States. Two years later, a different kind of war, The Cold War, would begin with
                    the Soviet Union.

                    Summary: Cartoon has an ostrich (labeled "Japan") burying its head in the sand (labeled
                    "Fanaticism") while in the background a fire (labeled "Inevitable Defeat") rages.
                    Makes fun of the Japanese’s refusal to consider surrender in the last year of the war, as shown
                    by
                    its use of suicide tactics (including kamikaze planes) and its planned defense of the home
                    islands.
                    In short, Japan is trying to bury its head into a fantasized “Invincible Japan” ideal when in
                    the
                    background it’s clear they are going to lose.
