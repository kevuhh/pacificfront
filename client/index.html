            <p>Beginning with the Pearl Harbor attacks, the Pacific Theater was fought mainly between the U.S and Japan
                and covered a large part of the Pacfic Ocean and Southeast Asia. Japan was easily moving across China
                and Southeast Asia, but the Japanese awoke a sleeping giant when they attacked America: they did not
                complete all the objectives of Pearl Harbor, and they vastly underestimated the industrial and military
                power of the United States.

            <img class="ui small right floated rounded image" src="/client/img/ship.jpeg">
            <p>With the element of surprise, the Japanese enjoyed early military victories,
                but by mid-1942, the tide was starting to turn. After the battle of Midway, the Americans began to
                control the Pacific Ocean. This battle is considered the beginning of the end, and once American
                carriers were in range of the mainland, American bombers conducted devastating raids on Japanese cities,
                culminating in the two atomic bombs that forced Japan to surrender. While smaller than the European
                Front, the Pacific Theater was a brutal, bloody affair that resulted in over two million deaths directly
                caused by military action and had impacts that are still felt today.

                This website explores the Pacific War in four aspects. The first being the attitudes toward the war of
                each nation. This includes the government's role as well as the ideas of "staying neutral" and Japanese
                imperialism. Also, there are categories for both land and naval battles, which also include the impact
                of technology and the conditions of the battles fought. Lastly, it explores the end of the war, which
                also includes the impacts beyond World War II itself.

                        America initially wanted to remain neutral in World War Two; they viewed the conflict as
                        “Europe’s problem” and thought getting involved would only harm the U.S. American citizens and
                        the government were not keen on getting involved in another potentially devastating conflict so
                        soon after World War One. When Pearl Harbor was attacked, Americans were shocked and angered,
                        and a poll a few days after the attack showed that 97% of Americans supported declaring war. War
                        was declared immediately after the attack on December 8. First, however, America needed to
                        intervene in Europe, as France had been taken over and Nazi Germany was advancing rapidly across
                        Europe. America was taken by surprise and lost much of its territory in the Pacific, but was not
                        able to immediately deal with the Japanese threat. America was united against Japan, and men
                        were drafted and encouraged to join the fight. Racism was also a factor in American hatred of
                        the Japanese; not only was there general racism among the American population, but executive
                        order 9066 rounded up over 120,000 Japanese-American citizens and placed them in internment
                        camps. The government feared that some were secretly spies and were disloyal to the U.S.

                <div class="ui raised segment">
                    <p>Even before America entered World War Two and the Pacific War began, Japan attempted to gain
                        territory in South and Southeast Asia to fuel its own territorial ambitions. Japan invaded China
                        and made rapid gains, also annexing Korea and Manchuria, among others. However, Japan was not
                        able to produce large quantities of important resources, such as rubber. During the 1930’s Japan
                        grew even more aggressive and militaristic, looking down on other nations and becoming
                        increasingly antagonistic towards America and its allies. Japan knew that it would eventually
                        have to fight a war if it wanted to realize its ambitions, and it started to build battleships
                        that violated treaties such as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. The Japanese navy gradually
                        began mobilizing, and the first fleet was formed on April 10th, 1941. In July 1941, Japan
                        invaded the southern part of French Indochina which prompted the U.S to impose an embargo on oil
                        products to Japan. Japan particularly wanted the Dutch East Indies for their oilfields, in
                        addition to the Philippines and Malaya. On December 7, 1941, after meticulous planning, Pearl
                        Harbor was attacked. This brought the United States into the war, united against the Japanese
                        and reeling from their initial losses.

                        The Japanese were unhappy with the outcome of World War One; while they were on the winning
                        side, they did not gain any territory and still had trouble producing important resources. The
                        Japanese government slowly became more militaristic and totalitarian, and Emperor Hirohito was
                        touted as a “living god.” Japanese schools taught that the Japanese were superior and other
                        nations were subhuman. Children were highly encouraged to join the military, and training began
                        in schools. Citizens were pressured or forced to either fight in the war or work as laborers.
                        The Pearl Harbor attack was partly to realize a Japanese victory over the United States, and
                        also as revenge for the U.S oil embargo and providing aid to the Chinese. When the war later
                        became desperate for the Japanese, they resorted to kamikaze - suicide tactics - methods in
                        order to win: they viewed surrender as highly dishonorable and it was expected that a soldier
                        would sacrifice himself for victory and they emporer. Even before World War One, Japanese High
                        Command had a list of potential enemies, of which one was the United States, showing that the
                        Japanese were always weary and preparing for war in the future.

                    Squads faced numerous diseases, including dengue fever, typhus, and jungle rot.

                    Allied soldiers captured by the Japanese could not expect to be treated well or even to survive for
                    very
                    long. In addition to their using their prisoners for forced labor and their brutal attitude towards
                    warfare,
                    the Japanese viewed surrender as the height of dishonor, and looked down on enemy soldiers that
                    surrendered,
                    viewing them as cowardly and less than human for surrendering instead of dying. They therefore did
                    not
                    always see an issue with mistreating enemy captives, and American POWs felt the consequences with
                    high
                    casualty rates. The Bataan death march is one of the most well-known instances of Japanese
                    mistreatment of
                    enemy POWs. The Japanese immediately invaded the Philippines after Pearl Harbor, and the Bataan
                    province
                    fell in April of 1942. Over 60,000 American and Filipino soldiers that survived the fight were taken
                    to a
                    Japanese prison camp where they were tortured and shown no mercy by Japanese soldiers; during which
                    several hundred soldiers died. A newspaper published in San Francisco in 1942 examines the horrors
                    that the
                    soldiers faced on the march; “the guards clubbed prisoners who tried to get water, and one prisoner
                    was
                    clubbed for helping a fellow prisoner who had been knocked down by a Japanese army truck. Soldiers
                    were
                    tortured or killed for trying to find food or escape. When the soldiers were finally liberated, a
                    further
                    2,200 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died at Camp O’Donnell, a U.S army camp that housed the
                    survivors.

                    Summary: Cartoon has an ostrich (labeled "Japan") burying its head in the sand (labeled
                    "Fanaticism") while in the background a fire (labeled "Inevitable Defeat") rages.
                    Makes fun of the Japanese’s refusal to consider surrender in the last year of the war, as shown by
                    its use of suicide tactics (including kamikaze planes) and its planned defense of the home islands.
                    In short, Japan is trying to bury its head into a fantasized “Invincible Japan” ideal when in the
                    background it’s clear they are going to lose.
